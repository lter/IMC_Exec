#IM Representatives to the Executive Board

IMEXEC tends to target particular people to serve as EB representative, although anyone can volunteer. The IMC votes on who will represent them, usually at the annual IMC business meeting before the term begins.
Service switch was typically at the Spring Science Council meeting, but beginning in 2017 or 2018 (TDB), it will begin after the Science Council meeting.

*Margaret O'Brien's EB Rep term was scheduled to end in 2017. Because Margaret has moved to full-time with EDI, she is stepping down from that position. Also in 2016, due to the transition from LNO to NCO and newly formed EDI, it is unclear how IMC will interact in this new environment. It was decided that IMC would suspend the ToR for one year and revisit governance next year. It was decided that IMEXEC would include only 5 people rather than 7. Both Gastil and Wade were serving as IMEXEC members and were also chosen to serve as IMC Chair and EB Rep, respectively. Elections were not held. It is not clear whether Wade is replacing Margaret or starting his own new 3 year term. Wade began attending EB meetings in September 2016 and rotates off of IMEXEC in 2018.
